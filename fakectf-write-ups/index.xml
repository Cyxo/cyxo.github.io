FakeBonk_Cashout_IT_Department_2022.odt This challenge gives us an ODT file (that I didn&amp;rsquo;t open, but you can do it at your own risk).

The challenge When we connect to the challenge, we are prompted to send a linux x86-64 shellcode, with a maximum length of 96 bytes.
The description of the challenge also says we have to display the content of a file called &amp;ldquo;flag&amp;rdquo; located in the same folder as the binary.</description></item></channel></rss>
